If we defined mathematical logic in terms of axioms and postulates without theorems, therefore we don't care about the ways to reach collaries in order to make sense of our thoughts.
Focusing on the structure, without the content or the deduction that can be used might lead us into superficiality, however, we can separate Mathematical Logic into
TWO realms, one of them seeks the foundations, which is axioms and postulates, the other focuses on the thorems and everything in-between.
Henceforth, by trying to create a foundational aspect about the foundations of Maths, we may be led into some insights about the nature of this field.
